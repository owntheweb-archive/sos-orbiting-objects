# SOS Dataset Generator: Orbiting Objects

![Three Fruity Flavors](three-fruity-flavors.jpg)

This cloud-based set of scripts is designed to generate three [Science On a Sphere](http://sos.noaa.gov/What_is_SOS/index.html) datasets at "the push of a button". Originally created as a one-off project, traffic around our Earth is changing frequently, creating a desire to make this simpler to update for my team at the [Space Foundation](http://www.spacefoundation.org). 

## Work-in-progress

This project is not in a usable state yet. I'm in the process of migrating scripts from a local manual-ish process to an automated cloud-based solution. I'll post components as they become usable.

## Datasets

This solution generates three animated datasets:

- All unclassified objects orbiting the Earth
- Objects by altitude
- Active objects vs. inactive objects

## Todo

Lots, including a todo list. Stay tuned.
